Non-conservative parameters are the reaction rates in the water column ${r_S}$ and in the hyporheic zone ${r_S}$.

We want to use the eDNA stream measurement to infer this reaction rates.

Two models the user can play and visualize in Concentration Profile plot:

1) Optimized: reaction rates are automatically calculated to fit best the eDNA data.

2) Manual: User can input the values of these parameters and interactively change them
