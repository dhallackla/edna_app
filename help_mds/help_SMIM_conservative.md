Conservative parameters could be obtained from breakthrough curves (BTCs) of non-reactant tracer pulse releases.

Users should have this information and manually input the values.

The default parameter values come from measured BTCs in LEEF streams (artificial experimental streams).

Different parametrization values from real streams can be found in the following references:
