Assuming steady-state conditions, the concentration reaches a fixed exponential decay profile with distance.

Users can change the extension distance and visualize the concentration profiles with the data uploaded  

Users can make a concentration prediction at a specific location downstream based on the two models (Optimized and Manual). The vertical line and text in the plot show concentration information relative to this location.
