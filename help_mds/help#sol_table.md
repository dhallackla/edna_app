The table lists the first ten cases matching the “Source PSD” criteria. 

The distance|time at the closest PSD to the “Source PSD” for each possible case. 

Nsim is a tag name for each extrapolation case performed.

The square root of the sum of the squared errors (“SSe”) represents the error of each case about the source PSD. It should always be below the tolerance criterion.
