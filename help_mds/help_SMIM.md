The SMIM model parameters can be divided in conservative and non-conservative:

${U}$ average velocity in the stream

${D}$ average dispersion in the stream
  
${\lambda}$ transfer rate between water column and hyporheic zone

${\beta}$ truncated power law exponent to describe residence time distribution in the hyporheic zone

${r_s}$ reaction rate in the water column

${r_h}$ reaction rate in the hyporheic zone
