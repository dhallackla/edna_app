**Comments:**  
The application could be used for other types of components as long as they decay independently in place of particle size.    
The app employs independent removal rates for various eDNA size categories, as outlined by [Brandao-Dias in 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.13751), to link changes in PSD with the distance between the source point and sampled points.  
The app employs the reactive Sthocastic Mobile and Immobile (SMIM) model (Schematics(b)) in steady-state conditions as outlined by [Roche 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JG004684).
