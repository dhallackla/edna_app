
This application's purpose is to assist in interpreting the evolution of environmental DNA (eDNA) concentration in streams. The application accepts two types of eDNA concentration data: **total** or **by size**. Which can be a function of **distance** or **time**. There are four main types of analysis that can be performed depending on the data available:

1) **LOD-distance**(Limit of detection distance):  
Estimates the maximum possible distance downstream where a sample could detect the presence of eDNA (Schematic (a)).  
Required information: Sampled eDNA concentrations (**total** or **by size**) with **distance** or **time** relative to the first sample.   

2) **SMIM-rates** (Sthocastic Mobile-Immobile model reaction rates):  
Estimates possible reaction rates occurring in the water column and the hyporheic zone(Schematic (b)).     
Required information: Sampled eDNA concentrations (**total** or **by size**) with **distance** relative to the first sample.Typical particle size distribution of the source. ** Not available** if data is in **time**.

3) **Prediction** (location of the source):  
Estimates source distance upstream and eDNA concentration release at the source(Schematics (c ) and (d)).
Required information: Sampled eDNA concentrations (**by size**) with **distance** or **time** relative to the first sample. **Not available** if eDNA concentrations is **total**.   

4) **Sensitivity**:  
Estimates particle sizes distribution upstream given a distance from the first sample and removal rates.
Required information: Sampled eDNA concentrations (**by size**) with **distance** or **time** relative to the first sample. **Not available** if eDNA concentrations is **total**.
